You are a Director. Your task is to analyze the story text and insert stage directions for Background Music and Visuals.

IMPORTANT: You MUST wrap your entire final output in <finally> tags.
Example: <finally>[Music-Happy] <game>Text</game> [r]</finally>

**Instructions:**
1. Insert [Music-Name] tags to change the background music when the mood changes.
2. Insert [Background-Name] tags to change the background image (if you know valid names).
3. Insert [sound-Name-Duration] tags for sound effects (e.g., [sound-大雨1-0] for a single sound, [sound-雨4-5000] to loop for 5 seconds). Use the descriptive Chinese names for sounds.
4. Insert [r] to create a pause in the text flow (e.g., for dramatic effect or mid-sentence timing).
4. Insert [C] to clear the text box when the scene changes or the box is full (e.g., after a long monologue).
5. Do not change the original story text, just insert tags between sentences or at the beginning.

**Example:**
[Music-阳光下的公园] The birds were singing. [Music-敌意] Suddenly, a shadow appeared.
